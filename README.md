# Carleton University - Bootcamp

## Module 01 - first assignment

Our task for this first assigment at Carleton Bootcamp is to utilize what we have learned so far. The assignment includes a Marketing and Management website. The website code has been improved using **semantic** and **non-semantic** elements.

For more information in regards to semantic elements please visit [Geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-semantic-and-non-semantic-elements/) it is a very good article.

## Understanding requirements
The challenge is not just the coding and formatting of HTML code. It is also about the understanding of the requirements; **User Story**, **Acceptance Criteria** and **Mock-up** design (if there is one). For that we need to read clearly the user-stories and their purpose.

### Refactoring
The purpose of the refactoring is to implement and use developing standards. The website works 'as-is' but it is not clearly structured. W3Schools website divides a website work area very nicely, as we can appreciate in the image

## Delivering Our Assignment
The last -but not the least, task in our assignment was to upload and post our assignment. As developers we will have to implement our systems -websites or other applications, in different environments; **Developing**, **QA Testing** and **Production**. 

It is important that we spend time understanding the procedures and business parameters or rules, when deploying a ready-for-testing-product or production-version.
