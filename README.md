# Carleton University - Bootcamp

## Module 01 - first assignment

Our task for this first assigment at Carleton Bootcamp is to utilize what we have learned so far. The assignment includes a Marketing and Management website. The website code has been improved using **semantic** and **non-semantic** elements.

For more information in regards to semantic elements please visit [Geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-semantic-and-non-semantic-elements/) it is a very good article.

## Understanding requirements
The challenge is not just the coding and formatting of HTML code. It is also about the understanding of the requirements; **User Story**, **Acceptance Criteria** and **Mock-up** design (if there is one). For that we need to read clearly the user-stories and their purpose.

### Refactoring
The purpose of the refactoring is to implement and use developing standards -such as semantic tags. The website works 'as-is' -browsers understand and render page correctly, but it is not clearly structured. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) divides the work area very nicely, as we can appreciate in the image

![Web Site Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_sem_elements.gif "Web Sites Main areas")

Semantic HTML tags used in the process:
<ol>
<li><strong>Main</strong> - Specifies the main content of a document. It</li>
<li><strong>Header</strong> - Specifies a header for a document or section</li>
<li><strong>Nav</strong> - Defines navigation links</li>
<li><strong>Section</strong> - Defines a section in a document</li>
<li><strong>Figure</strong> - Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Article</strong> - Defines independent, self-contained content</li>
<li><strong>Aside</strong> - Defines content aside from the page content</li>
</ol>

## Updating GitHub Repository
Based on Wikipedia Github is define as "a platform and cloud-based service for software development and version control using Git, allowing developers to store and manage their code." As developers it is important that we keep our versions, in case reversing changes is necessary.

Github, though it is integrated nicely in our gui editors such as `Visual Code` or `Visual Studio suits` , we need to understand Git -a version control system. We have use several commands to register our changes in GitHub:

<ul>
<li><strong>git pull</strong> - Download changes and directly merge/integrate new code</li>
<li><strong>git checkout main</strong> - Checkout the main branch</li>
<li><strong>git add -A [comments]</strong> - Include comments related to changes. Includes all changes</li>
<li><strong>git pull origin main</strong> - Download changes and directly merge/integrate new code</li>
<li><strong>git status</strong> - Displays changed files in your working directory</li>
</ul>

## Delivering Our Assignment
The last -but not the least, task in our assignment was to upload and post our assignment. As developers we will have to implement our systems -websites or other applications, in different environments; **Developing**, **QA Testing** and **Production**. 

It is important that we spend time understanding the procedures and business parameters or rules, when deploying a ready-for-testing-product or production-version.
